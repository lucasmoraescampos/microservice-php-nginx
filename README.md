# microservice-php-nginx

In this project, I will provide a demonstration of the process of dockerizing your micro-services project with PHP and Laravel alongside with nginx as a web server and mysql.
This will allow us to set up the foundation of our project, dockerize its main components and to establish the basics in order to make a fluid communication between all components.

Here is the Medium post related to this project:
